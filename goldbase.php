      <h1>A brief history of digital CryptoCoins</h1>  
      <p>
          Many Cryptocurrencies are just worthless due to no backing of solid assets and even Bitcoin is only speculation and Monkey stories on internet just to lure innocent customers as there has to be real value to each coin and after lot of research and arguments the WorldCoin committee come to a conclusion that only Gold can be a real value to a cryptocoin, so WorldCoin is first goldbase digitalcoin in the world, that’s why we call it<span class="wc-text">WORLD COIN</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        World Coin also save you buying worthless codes on the name of crypto currencies, so it gives you real value in gold and you never loose a cent of your money and seeing last 50 years of gold prices, it always rise gradually and considered as safe investment.

          In 2017 the price of bitcoin reached parity with gold (by ounce) which grabbed the attention of gold investors around the world. With the current crypto mania there has been a surge in interest with the concept of gold-backed cryptocurrencies opposite to worthless crypto currencies codes.
      </p>
      <p>

        The idea of a gold CryptoCoin has always had an appeal for those looking for an alternative payment system. Not long after the internet went mainstream <span class="wc-text">E-Gold</span> emerged as first digital currency backed entirely by gold in 1995.
      </p>
      <p>
          Other attempts to make a <span class="wc-text">digital gold currency</span>currency were also made, but this was before the age of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology
      </p>
      <p>
        Now with blockchain technology established as a secure accounting method, a new era of gold-backed cryptocoins is emerging. There is a proverbial (and literal) gold rush happening now in the crypto world, and even countries are looking to issue their own <span class="wc-text">Gold-based cryptocurrency</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic concept is certainly compelling. A digital token or Cryptocoin is issued that represents a value of gold (for example 3 gram of gold equals 1 world coin). The real gold is stored by a trusted custodian a reputed company in the world, and can be traded with other coin holders and transactions are secured by blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a minimum the price of the world coin will always equal the current gold rate. If the cryptocoin becomes popular then the price of the coin can potentially increase in value, greater than the value of gold. If the cryptocoin doesn’t take off then the value remains as the value of the gram of gold. It’s like a built-in stop-loss.<span class="wc-text">built-in stop-loss</span>.
