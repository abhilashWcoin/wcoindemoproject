              <p style="padding-top: 40px;font-style: italic; color: #B17400;">Rare and difficult to acquire, gold has always been treasured and sought after by all cultures. The Latin name for Gold is AURUM, which means morning blush or glowing dawn. It is from this word “aurum” the chemical symbol AU was derived. Gold possesses a number of desirable physical characteristics that have all contributed to making it one of the most valuable commodities in the world.</br></p>

           <div class="col-sm-12 why-trade">
               <p>There are many benefits and advantages to trading Commodities. Here are just a few reasons why so many people are choosing this market as a profitable business opportunity:</p>
               
                <h3>Liquidity</h3>
                <p>The Gold & Commodities Market is extremely liquid. This means that with a click of a mouse you can instantaneously buy and sell. Whether it's morning or evening, somewhere in the world there are always buyers and sellers actively trading. You are never 'stuck' in a trade. You can even set the online trading platform to automatically close your position at your desired profit level (limit order), and/or close a trade if a trade is going against you (stop order).</p>
                
                
                <h3>Less Initial Deposit</h3>
                <p>Many traders see the low deposit requirements to be a major advantage. Consider this illustration: The purchase of just a single lot of gold presently covers roughly $1200 worth of gold but requires minimum initial deposit of just $120 (based on recent market prices) which is only 10% of the total value and the rest 90% on delivery after 60 days.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Opportunities in both rising and falling markets</h3>
                <p>If you think the price of a commodity market is about to move higher, you can buy. However, if you believe a commodity price is going to decline, you can sell your gold online just as easily as click of button and buy back once price goes down to make profits.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Low transaction cost</h3>
                <p>There is very less transaction cost i.e $1 per lot of buying and $1 per lot for selling, this commission is further divided as referral commission.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Uncorrelated to the stock market</h3>
                <p>A trader in the Commodities market is involved in selling or buying a commodity. Thus, there is no correlation between the commodities market and the stock market. A bull market or a bear market for a commodity is defined in terms of the outlook for its relative value against US Dollar. If the outlook is positive, we have a bull market in which a trader profits by buying. Conversely, if the outlook is pessimistic, we have a bear market and traders take profits by selling. In either case, there is always a good market trading opportunity for a trader.</p>
                
                
                <h3>No one can corner the market</h3>
                <p>The Commodities market is so vast and has so many participants that no single entity, not even a central bank, can control the market price for an extended period of time. Even interventions by mighty central banks are becoming increasingly ineffectual and short lived.</p>
