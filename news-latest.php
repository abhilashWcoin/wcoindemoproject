        <p>Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges are strengthening their self-regulation procedures following the hack of one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges, Coincheck. The Japanese Financial Services Agency has yet to approve Coincheck’s registration as a crypto exchange.</p>

          <p>Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) has previously established self-regulation standards which its cryptocurrency exchange members voluntarily adopt. The standards include “the maintenance of cold wallet, etc., under the consent of the related members,” the association announced on Saturday after one of its members, Coincheck, suffered a hack which led to an approximately 58 billion yen loss on its platform.</p>

          <p>he association currently has 127 members, 15 of them are crypto exchange members and 35 are blockchain members. Among crypto exchange members are Bitflyer, Coincheck, GMO Coin, and Bitocean. Bitflyer CEO Yuzo Kano is the association’s representative director.

          According to the JBA’s announcement:
          The association noted that the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has alerted the representatives of each cryptocurrency exchange regarding their security. “We are looking for further measures,” the JBA emphasized, adding that its crypto exchange members have been told to “check the status of [their] security based on the possibility of cyber attack.” The association noted:
          In the future, in order to appropriately secure the security of virtual currency exchange traders…we will establish stricter voluntary regulations and seek compliance with members.
