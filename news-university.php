Imagine getting treated by a doctor with a fake diploma, or losing a job to another candidate who faked his resume. Unfortunately, such cases are all too prevalent these days in various parts of the world where proper documentation verification is too cumbersome or too costly. However, bitcoin might provide the answer to making sure this reality is preventable in the future.

Bitcoin CV Verification
University College London Fights CV Fraud via Bitcoin VerificationUniversity College London (UCL) has announced that its Centre for Blockchain Technologies has concluded a pilot program enabling MSc graduates in Financial Risk Management to offer instant verification of their academic qualifications using bitcoin.

All graduates of this course in 2016 and 2017 could register their degree details on a platform developed by London-based startup Gradbase. The school checked the validity of this data and then the system issued a transaction validating the authenticity of these degrees via bitcoin. The participating graduates received a QR code they can place on their CV documents, business cards or professional profiles which anyone can scan to verify their credentials.

The company’s co-founder, Cédric Colle, commented: “Academic fraud is a global issue which needs a global solution. The ambition of Gradbase is to become the first platform for easily and trustworthily verifying any qualification around the world.”
