          <h3>The Facts About Referral Commission:</h3>
          <p>Fact 1: Referral commission is the most effective technique for creating steady streams of prospects and clients.</p>

          <p>Fact 2: According to a recent Jupiter Media Metrix survey, 70 percent of Internet users are compelled to visit new websites through referrals. Referral-generated customers are the most cost efficient, profitable, and loyal source of new business. Plus, they tend to buy quicker, negotiate less, buy larger quantities, and refer more business to you.</p>

           <h3>What does a referral have to do with marketing?</h3>
           <p>Off the Internet, referral marketing has been described as "word-of-mouth" marketing. Referral marketing describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others, creating the potential for exponential growth through the message's exposure and influence. Such strategies take advantage of rapid multiplication to potentially expose the message to thousands and eventually to millions.</p>
            <h3>Anyone can do it.</h3>
            <p>There are no required levels of education, experience, financial resources or physical condition. People of all ages and from all backgrounds have succeeded in referral marketing.</p>
            <h3>You're your own boss, which means you can:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Work part-time or full-time - you choose when and how much you want to work.</li>
                <li>  Set your own goals and determine for yourself, how to reach them.</li>
                <li>Earn in proportion to your own efforts. The level of success you can achieve is limited only by your willingness to work hard.</li>
                <li>Own a business of your own with very little or no capital investment.</li>
                <li>Receive expert training and support from successful professionals and
