Cryptocurrency miners in Singapore can now buy their rigs pre-assembled right at the mall as more retail computer hardware shops enter this booming market. This is another strong sign of how retailers are diversifying away from their traditional costumers such as PC gamers, all due to the allure of cryptocurrency earnings.

Singapore Mining Mall
Singapore Mall Sells Cryptocurrency Mining Hardware
Sim Lim Square complex, which houses many of the computer spare parts retail shops in Singapore
At least five computer stores are now selling cryptocurrency mining rigs in Singapore’s Sim Lim Square, according to a report from the region. The six-story complex is mainly known for attracting tourists from around Asia with its cheap electronics, shopping bargains, and many computer spare parts and service shops. However, Singaporeans these days want more cryptocurrency hardware than another knockoff mobile phone or gaming laptop, and local businesses are adopting to meet this demand.

One shop owner, Wilson Josup sells about ten rigs on a weekly basis, up from just one or two when he first started selling them about six months ago. He said that based on customer testimonials, letting a S$4,000 rig operate non-stop can earn around S$400 a month. And clients range from those in their 20s to retirees, he told the South China Morning Post. “Most of my customers would ask me to help transfer the rigs from their homes to a data center because they don’t like the heat and noise,” noted Josup, adding that his profit margin on each rig was around 10%.

Another store owner, Trecia Tay, has yet not sold any mining rigs but explains she now receives about ten inquiries about them every week, five times the amount of questions from just three months ago.

Background
Computer Shops in Singapore Sell Cryptocurrency Mining Hardware Right at the MallSingapore serves as a global regulatory, financial and logistics hub for many companies in Asia. When the government of China started to threaten a clampdown on bitcoin-related activities under its jurisdiction, a number of Chinese businesses officially migrated to the island nation including bitcoin exchanges and miners. The country stands to benefit much more from this trend if it will continue to provide an accommodating and stable regulatory environment.

Beyond just Singapore, this story exemplifies how cryptocurrency miners are overcrowding the retail computer market all over the world. In a related matter, GPU manufacturer Nvidia recently requested retailers take measures to try and ensure its products get into the hands of gamers, not miners.
