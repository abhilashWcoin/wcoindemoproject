          <p class="p-type-5 color-grey margin-t20">A cryptocoin is a real asset designed to work as an investment that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the minting of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.Cryptocoins are classified as a subset of digital base real assets and are also classified as a subset of alternative payment methods like if you want to pay a client or vendor in cryptocoins. Cryptocoin use decentralized control as opposed to centralized control and central data system.The decentralized control of each cryptocoin works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database, functioning as a distributed ledger. World Coin was created in 2007, was the first decentralized cryptocoin opposite to worthless crypto currencies. Since then, numerous other cryptocoin have been created. These are frequently called real assets, So World Coin is top in the Line. Most of the monkey business companies avoid backing Crypto Coins by any valuable assets and selling only a worthless code and called it cryptocurrency which is considered illegal in India, China, Korea and many other countries as you get nothing by paying huge money. These Crypto Currencies are true Example of Monkey Business and Bitcoin is biggest Conngame on earth where investor lost billions of Dollars, so Cryptocoin backed by real gold is the true investment as you are buying real gold and transactions are secured by Blockchain. WorldCoin only sell its CryptoCoins on Market price and no markup or extra fee, You can daily check prices of your CryptoCoin on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/commodity">https://www.reuters.com/finance/commodity</a></p>
